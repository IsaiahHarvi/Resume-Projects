# Resume Projects
This repository holds the source code for projects that I have listed on past résumés.

Some projects, such as Urbansift, are in private repositories as they are monetized.

Other projects that are listed on my résumé are in the following repositories:
[Hotel Database Management System](https://github.com/IsaiahHarvi/CS321-T9)
[Pathfinding AI](https://github.com/IsaiahHarvi/CS-330)
